## Shadow Finance

Shadow Finance is a privacy-focused automated market maker (AMM) built on the Aleo blockchain. It leverages Aleo's zero-knowledge snark technology to enable trustless private trading.

At present, the project supports a limited selection of two premade tokens, primarily designed for demonstration purposes. Each token has a set of interactive functions that users can engage with, either directly or through the swap itself. This setup allows for experimentation and exploration of the token functionalities within the project's framework. both tokens have a total supply limit of one hundred billion (100000000000).


### How To Get Started



### Functions
To use the swap , you must first mint tokens from the token programs or receive tokens from another account. Here is a list of token functions and their descriptions (both tokens have identical functions):


# mint
The mint(owner: address, amount: u64) function serves as a mechanism to assign a user an arbitrary number of tokens, effectively creating a record of ownership. Currently, anyone can utilize the mint function. Once the mint process is finalized, the total supply of the token will be adjusted accordingly, reflecting the newly issued tokens. mint has an upper limit of 100000 for its input
