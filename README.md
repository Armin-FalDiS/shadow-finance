## Shadow Finance

Shadow Finance is a privacy-focused automated market maker (AMM) built on the Aleo blockchain. It leverages Aleo's zero-knowledge snark technology to enable trustless private trading.

At present, the project supports a limited selection of two premade tokens, primarily designed for demonstration purposes. Each token has a set of interactive functions that users can engage with, either directly or through the swap itself. This setup allows for experimentation and exploration of the token functionalities within the project's framework. both tokens have a total supply limit of one hundred billion (100000000000).
